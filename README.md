To build an app with Unity, you first need to create a project. This project is organized into a few folders, the most important of which is your Assets folder. This is the folder that holds all assets you import from digital content creation tools such as Maya, Max Cinema 4D or Photoshop, all code you create with Visual Studio or your favorite code editor, and any number of content files that Unity creates as you compose scenes, animations and other Unity asset types in the editor.


  1. Create location on the computer for the project
  2. Start Unity
  3. Select New
  4. Enter a project name (e.g. "UB101")
  5. Enter a location to save your project
  6. Ensure the 3D toggle is selected
  7. Select Create project
  8. Create a cube
  9. Upload the files to GitHub
